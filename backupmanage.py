# This script creates backups in storagelocation with the name of the key in directories. Only when
# a file in the value of directories is modified does a new backup get created. The folder for the backups
# is automatically created where needed. 
#
# For reference, if you wanted to add another directory just create another line below the example below like so:
# directories["key"] = "value"
# directories["Mass Effect"] = "C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Mass Effect\Saved Games\"
#
# With no wildcard specified at the end of the value, the script will grab the entire folder. If you put a *
# afterwards, only the files in that folder recursively will be grabbed. The backups will be stored in the folder
# "Mass Effect" as a subdirectory of config["storagelocation"].
